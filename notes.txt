Lable Widgets
To add a label to our previous example,
we will create a label using the label class like this:
-> lbl = Label(window, text="Hello")

HANDLE THE BUTTON CLICK EVENT
First we write the function that we need to execute when the button is clicked
Then we will wire it the button by specifing the finction inside the button

GET INPUT USING ENTRY CLASS
We can create a textbox using Tkinter Entry like this:
    txt = Entry(windo, width=10)

SET FOCUS TO THE ENTRY WIDGETS 
All we need to do is to use the .focus() keyword

#CREATE A SIMPLECALCULATOR2
1. The title of the calculator will be your name
2. The background color should be green
3. The size of the app should be 400 by 300
4. For each button indicate a symbol eg addition -> +
5. Change the location of the buttons following this procedure
    add was c=0,r=0 -> c=0,r=4
    subtraction was c=0,r=4 -> c=0,r=3
    Multiplication was c=1,r=3 -> c=1,r=4
    division was c=1,r=4 -> c=1,r=3
